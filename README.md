Creating a login app (sans authentication) for general React practice with minimal styling.

The main focus is getting used to the useEffect, useReducer, and useContext hooks as all of it likely will be useful for our 4th semester project.

Since the styling is very simple, it seemed like a good project for trying out  CSS-modules and creating reusable UI components like buttons and cards.
